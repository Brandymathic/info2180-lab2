            <p>My drive for Computer Science came about
        when I had finished High School. I discoverd that 
        I had a strength in understanding and manipulating 
        computer from a tender age. Wether it was through
        helping my friends or family members with issues that 
        they may have had in regards to using their devices.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

            <p>In general I tended to have a genuine interest in
        different parts and functions of computers. When I had
        discovered that I had this interest is when I did 
        Information Technology as a subject in grade 11.
        Then this fascination began to grow as I did 
        Computer Science as a subject in CAPE unit 1
        and CAPE unit 2.

    <p>As it drew closer to the end of the second semester in my
    first year of university. I began to realise that I had an 
    interest in website building. It is rather engaging, and fun
    to me. Not only do I want to pursue Web Development because it
    is fun, but it can also be profitable to me in the future.</p>

    <p>I think that it is important to have some form of education
        in web development. In this day and age it is very beneficial
        to have knowledge in computers and programming. It can help you
        to grow your personal business or be used for your own personal use.
